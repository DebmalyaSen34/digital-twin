No objective coefficients in model. Unclear what should be optimized
Missing flux bounds on reactions set to default bounds.As best practise and to avoid confusion flux bounds should be set explicitly on all reactions.
Could not identify an external compartment by name and choosing one with the most boundary reactions. That might be complete nonsense or change suddenly. Consider renaming your compartments using `Model.compartments` to fix this.
